# Enrollment Data Persistence - Fixes Applied

## Problem Summary
The agent dashboard was displaying mocked or incomplete data because:
1. Enrollment API endpoints didn't include customer information in responses
2. Customer data was stored but not retrieved with enrollments
3. Step data updates didn't sync back to the customer table
4. The frontend couldn't access real customer data from the database

## Changes Made

### 1. Enrollment Service - enrollment.service.js

#### `getById()` - Now includes customer data
- **Before**: Only fetched enrollment table data
- **After**: LEFT JOIN with customers table to include customer information
- **Result**: Enrollment responses now include a `customer` object with:
  - first_name, last_name, middle_name
  - email, phone, cin
  - date_of_birth, address

#### `list()` - Now includes customer data for all enrollments
- **Before**: Only returned enrollment table data
- **After**: LEFT JOIN with customers table for all enrollments
- **Result**: Dashboard can display actual customer names from database

#### `getSummary()` - Enhanced to return complete data
- **Before**: Fetched data but didn't properly parse JSON fields
- **After**: Uses getById() for enrollment data and properly parses step_data JSON
- **Result**: Summary page shows complete, accurate enrollment information

### 2. Step Data Service - stepData.service.js

#### `save()` - Now updates customer records
- **Added**: When saving `customer_info` step, automatically updates the customers table
- **Updates**: CIN, names, birth date, phone, address from subscriber data
- **Result**: Customer table stays in sync with enrollment form data

#### `get()` and `getAll()` - Proper JSON parsing
- **Added**: Automatically parses step_data JSON strings
- **Result**: Frontend receives properly structured data objects

### 3. Frontend - EnrollmentConfirmation.tsx

#### Summary loading
- **Updated**: Now correctly uses `enrollment.customer` object from API
- **Fallback**: Maintains backward compatibility with old data structure
- **Result**: Displays accurate customer information

## Database Schema (No changes needed)

The existing schema already supports all requirements:

```sql
-- customers table has all fields needed
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  cin VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  date_of_birth DATE,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  address JSONB,
  ...
);

-- enrollments table references customers
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  ...
);

-- enrollment_step_data stores form data as JSON
CREATE TABLE enrollment_step_data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  enrollment_id UUID REFERENCES enrollments(id),
  step_id VARCHAR(100),
  step_data JSONB,
  ...
);
```

## Data Flow (Fixed)

### Before (Broken):
1. Agent creates enrollment → customer saved to DB
2. Agent fills form → step_data saved but customer not updated
3. Agent views dashboard → no customer data in response ❌
4. Agent clicks enrollment → sees old/mock data ❌

### After (Fixed):
1. Agent creates enrollment → customer saved to DB
2. Agent fills form → step_data saved AND customer updated ✅
3. Agent views dashboard → customer data included in response ✅
4. Agent clicks enrollment → sees real, current data ✅

## API Response Structure (Updated)

### GET /api/v1/enrollments/:id
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "draft",
    "customer": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "cin": "ABC123",
      "phone": "+212600000000",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "address": {...}
    },
    "completed_steps": ["customer_info"],
    ...
  }
}
```

### GET /api/v1/enrollments (list)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "status": "draft",
      "customer": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        ...
      },
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET /api/v1/enrollments/:id/summary
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "enrollment": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "customer": {...},
      ...
    },
    "billing": {...},
    "beneficiaries": [...],
    "steps": [
      {
        "step_id": "customer_info",
        "step_data": {
          "subscriber": {...},
          "insured": {...}
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all changes:

```bash
./test-enrollment-persistence.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a new enrollment with customer data
2. Save customer info step data
3. Verify customer data is included in enrollment response
4. Verify customer data is included in list response
5. Verify summary includes all data
6. Verify step data is properly saved and retrieved

## Files Modified

1. `enrollment-service/src/services/enrollment.service.js`
   - Updated `getById()` to join customer data
   - Updated `list()` to join customer data
   - Updated `getSummary()` to use getById and parse JSON

2. `enrollment-service/src/services/stepData.service.js`
   - Added customer update logic in `save()` for customer_info step
   - Added JSON parsing in `get()` and `getAll()`

3. `src/components/EnrollmentConfirmation.tsx`
   - Updated to use `enrollment.customer` object

## Next Steps

1. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd enrollment-service && npm start

   # Terminal 2
   cd agent-service && npm start

   # Terminal 3
   npm start  # Frontend
   ```

2. **Test the Flow**:
   - Login as an agent
   - Create a new enrollment
   - Fill in customer information
   - Save and return to dashboard
   - Verify customer name appears correctly
   - Click to view/edit enrollment
   - Verify all data is restored from database

3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add enrollment-service/src/services/enrollment.service.js
   git add enrollment-service/src/services/stepData.service.js
   git add src/components/EnrollmentConfirmation.tsx
   git commit -m "fix: enrollment data persistence and customer info display

   - Join customer data in enrollment list and getById queries
   - Auto-update customer records when saving customer_info step
   - Parse step_data JSON in all retrieval methods
   - Update frontend to use customer object from enrollment
   - Add comprehensive test script for data flow verification"
   ```

## Key Improvements

✅ **No more mocked data** - All data comes from database
✅ **Real-time updates** - Customer table stays in sync with form data
✅ **Complete data restoration** - Agent can resume exactly where they left off
✅ **Simplified architecture** - Customer data accessible directly from enrollment
✅ **Better data integrity** - Single source of truth for customer information

## Performance Considerations

- LEFT JOIN adds minimal overhead (indexed foreign keys)
- JSON parsing happens in application layer (fast)
- No N+1 queries - everything fetched in one query
- Customer data cached with enrollment response

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing enrollments work with new code
- Fallback logic handles old data structures
- No database migrations required
- Gradual data migration through normal usage
